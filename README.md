# CS691 Menu Project README.md

## Project Description

This end of the semester project entails creating an interactive menu over the course of three iterations. It is designed to test our knowledge of good software engineering processes and working in a vague and rapid environment.

Only bits and pieces of the project will be released with each iteration. Our instructor will serve as both teacher and client. Questions should be directed him either in person or via email.

## Technology Choices

I have chosen to develop a web application. I am developing on a Linux based server hosted by Hostgator. I will be using PhP 5.4 as my server side software. I will use HTML5 and CSS3 for the client side software. I avoid the use of Javascript; however, should I find it to be the only solution to my issue, then I will use it to resolve my problem. I am GitHub as a repository for my files. I attempted to use Eclipse with two different PhP plugins, but I was unsuccessful in finding the solutions I desired; so, I switched back to my preferred tool, the Adobe Creative Suite version 6. Most specifically, Dreamweaver and Fireworks. Additionally, I use a couple of Firefox plugins to help me verify code for HTML standards compliance and occasional debugging. 

## Dependencies

I have created no special case dependencies that I am aware of. My files are uploaded to GitHub manually and to the host server via an FTP connection. I am utilizing PhP 5.4 as if is the version I am most familiar with and changing to a newer version would cause issues with other sites I am hosting on that account. I will need to choose a tool for unit testing.
