## Iteration 1 Requirements

 1. Due to the persistent nature of the above requirements, a database is likely the best solution. Unless the site were to remain rather small, then a flat file solution might also work. **High Priority**
 2. Create a web menu. **High Priority**
	 a. The menu should contain the following parts: entry name, ingredients, allergen information, and pricing.
	 b. The pricing should be to the side.
	 c. The entries should be broken down by categories.
 3. The owner will be the only employee to add/remove menu items. **High Priority**
 4. The company logo will be at the top of the page. **High Priority**
 5. The tagline should have at least 2 creative stylings to choose from. **High Priority**
 6. An editable tagline should be near the logo. **High Priority**
 7. The rest of the staff can edit the ingredients, allergen information, and pricing. **Medium Priority**
 8. There should be a raw food warning at the bottom of the menu. **Low Priority**
All items seem to be complete, correct, feasible, necessary, verifiable, consistent, modifiable, traceable for the first iteration. However, please note, this is not how would normally take on such a job. I would spend much more time covering finer details before proceeding.

## Iteration 2 Requirements

 1. Customers to place orders. **High Priority**
 2. Director to assign incoming orders to servers to prepare. **High Priority**
 3. Owner to generate weekly reports on orders and server workload. **High Priority**
 All items seem to be complete, correct, feasible, necessary, verifiable, consistent, modifiable, traceable for the second iteration. However, there was a bit of vagueness regarding the clients desire to use this software at more than one location. Nothing in my design will prevent that, but it is not something I have directly planned for at this time.

## Iteration 3 Requirements

 1. Add 3 restaurant functionality that was missed during the 2nd iteration. **High Priority**
 2. Add the ability for the customers to add a tip to their order. **Low Priority**
 3. Add the ability for the customer to check the status of their order. **Medium Priority**
 4. Add the ability for the director to change the status of the orders. **High Priority**

 Confirmed tip was to be a monetary amount added before order was received or service provided. Clarified the customer did indeed want one system for 3 restaurants. Everything else seems to be in order and ready to proceed.
